If the prediction is correct, no adjustment is made.\\n\\nIf the prediction is wrong, the weights are updated by a factor proportional to the input values and the learning rate. This correction aims to reduce the error in future predictions.\\n\\nBy continuously adjusting the weights based on errors, the perceptron learns to classify the input data accurately.'"

This means they can use their internal state (memory) to process sequences of inputs. Unlike traditional neural networks, RNNs maintain a hidden state that is updated as they process each element of the sequence, giving them the ability to remember previous inputs.\\n\\nHandling Sequential Data:\\nSequential Processing:\\n\\nRNNs process data one time step at a time. For example, in a sentence, each word is processed sequentially.\\n\\nHidden State:\\n\\nAt each time step, the RNN updates its hidden state \\nh\\nt\\n based on the previous hidden state \\nh\\nt\\n−\\n1\\n and the current input \\nx\\nt\\n:\\n\\nh\\nt\\n=\\nactivation\\n(\\nW\\nh\\nh\\nt\\n−\\n1\\n+\\nW\\nx\\nx\\nt\\n+\\nb\\n)\\nThis hidden state carries information through the sequence, enabling the network to maintain context over the entire sequence.\\n\\nOutput Generation:\\n\\nThe output at each time step can be influenced by the entire history of inputs, which makes RNNs powerful for tasks like language modeling, where the context of previous words affects the prediction of the next word.\\n\\nExample Applications:\\nNatural Language Processing: Tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation.\\n\\nTime Series Forecasting: Predicting stock prices, weather forecasting, and other temporal data analysis.\\n\\nSpeech Recognition: Converting spoken words into text.'"
